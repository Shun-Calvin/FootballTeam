## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18 or later)
-   pnpm (or your package manager of choice)
-   A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_project_name.git)
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your Supabase environment variables:**
    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
    -   Add your Supabase project URL and anon key:
        ```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
        NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
        ```
4.  **Run the database schema:**
    -   Navigate to the SQL Editor in your Supabase project.
    -   Copy the contents of `scripts/01-create-tables.sql` and run it to set up your database tables and policies.
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

The project is organized with a clean and scalable folder structure:

-   **`/app`**: The core of the application, following the Next.js App Router structure. Each folder represents a route.
-   **`/components`**: Contains all the React components.
    -   **`/ui`**: For small, reusable UI primitives (e.g., Button, Card, Input).
-   **`/contexts`**: Holds React Context providers for managing global state (e.g., authentication, language).
-   **`/hooks`**: For custom React hooks (e.g., `use-mobile` for responsive design).
-   **`/lib`**: Contains utility functions and third-party library configurations (e.g., Supabase client, i18n translations).
-   **`/public`**: For static assets like images and the PWA manifest.
-   **`/scripts`**: Holds SQL scripts for setting up the database schema.
-   **`/types`**: Contains TypeScript type definitions.
